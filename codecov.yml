# "flags" are used to identify subsets of the overall codebase when calculating coverage.
# Currently used for "remote_data" (pvlib.iotools) and "core" (everything else).
# Because we only run the remote_data tests sometimes, we need to split it out so that
# codecov doesn't report a big drop in coverage when we don't run them.
# We also use "carryforward: true" so that, when we don't run remote_data tests, the last
# known coverage is carried forward and used in place of the missing coverage.
