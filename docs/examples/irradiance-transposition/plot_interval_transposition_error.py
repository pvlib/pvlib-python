Modeling with interval averages
===============================

Transposing interval-averaged irradiance data
"""

# %%
# This example shows how failing to account for the difference between
# instantaneous and interval-averaged time series data can introduce
# error in the modeling process. An instantaneous time series
# represents discrete measurements taken at each timestamp, while
# an interval-averaged time series represents the average value across
# each data interval.  For example, the value of an interval-averaged
# hourly time series at 11:00 represents the average value between
# 11:00 (inclusive) and 12:00 (exclusive), assuming the series is left-labeled.
# For a right-labeled time series it would be the average value
# between 10:00 (exclusive) and 11:00 (inclusive).  Sometimes timestamps
# are center-labeled, in which case it would be the
# average value between 10:30 and 11:30.
# Interval-averaged time series are common in
# field data, where the datalogger averages high-frequency measurements
# into low-frequency averages for archiving purposes.
#
# It is important to account for this difference when using
# interval-averaged weather data for modeling.  This example
# focuses on calculating solar position appropriately for
# irradiance transposition, but this concept is relevant for
# other steps in the modeling process as well.
#
# This example calculates a POA irradiance timeseries at 1-second
# resolution as a "ground truth" value.  Then it performs the
# transposition again at lower resolution using interval-averaged
# irradiance components, once using a half-interval shift and
# once just using the unmodified timestamps. The difference
# affects the solar position calculation: for example, assuming
# we have average irradiance for the interval 11:00 to 12:00,
# and it came from a left-labeled time series, naively using
# the unmodified timestamp will calculate solar position for 11:00,
# meaning the calculated solar position is used to represent
# times as far as an hour away.  A better option would be to
# calculate the solar position at 11:30 to reduce the maximum
# timing error to only half an hour.
