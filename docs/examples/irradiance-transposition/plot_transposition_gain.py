Modeling Transposition Gain
===========================

Calculating the gain in insolation of a tilted module over a flat module.
"""

# %%
# This example shows how to evaluate the transposition gain of a racking
# strategy.  The transposition gain is the additional insolation collected
# by orienting at a tilt instead of horizontal; using PV modeling lingo, it's
# the increase in POA (plane of array) insolation over GHI (global horizontal
# irradiance) insolation.
#
# This example uses a TMY dataset and the
# :py:meth:`pvlib.irradiance.get_total_irradiance` function to transpose
# irradiance components to POA irradiance for various fixed tilts.  It also
# models a single-axis tracking system for comparison. The monthly POA
# insolation is calculated for each strategy to show how orientation affects
# seasonal irradiance collection.

# TMY3 datasets are right-labeled (AKA "end of interval") which means the last
# interval of Dec 31, 23:00 to Jan 1 00:00 is labeled Jan 1 00:00. When rolling
# up hourly irradiance to monthly insolation, a spurious January value is
# calculated from that last row, so we'll just go ahead and drop it here:
tmy = tmy.iloc[:-1, :]

# create location object to store lat, lon, timezone
location = location.Location.from_tmy(metadata)

# calculate the necessary variables to do transposition.  Note that solar
# position doesn't depend on array orientation, so we just calculate it once.
# Note also that TMY datasets are right-labeled hourly intervals, e.g. the
# 10AM to 11AM interval is labeled 11.  We should calculate solar position in
# the middle of the interval (10:30), so we subtract 30 minutes:
times = tmy.index - pd.Timedelta("30min")

# %%
# Note that in summer, steeper tilts actually collect less insolation than
# flatter tilts because the sun is so high in the sky at solar noon.  However,
# the steeper tilts significantly increase insolation capture in winter when
# the sun is lower in the sky.  In contrast to the highly seasonal gain shown
# by fixed tilts, the tracker system shows a much more consistent gain
# year-round.
#
# Because the seasonality of the fixed-tilt transposition gain is driven by
# solar position angles, the relative behavior of different orientations will
# be different for different locations.  For example, a common rule of thumb
# (considered somewhat outdated today) used to be to set tilt equal to the
# latitude of the system location.  At higher latitudes, the sun doesn't get
# as high in the sky, so steeper tilts make more sense.
