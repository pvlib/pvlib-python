Calculating power loss from partial module shading
==================================================

Example of modeling cell-to-cell mismatch loss from partial module shading.
"""

# %%
# Even though the PV cell is the primary power generation unit, PV modeling is
# often done at the module level for simplicity because module-level parameters
# are much more available and it significantly reduces the computational scope
# of the simulation.  However, module-level simulations are too coarse to be
# able to model effects like cell to cell mismatch or partial shading.  This
# example calculates cell-level IV curves and combines them to reconstruct
# the module-level IV curve.  It uses this approach to find the maximum power
# under various shading and irradiance conditions.
#
# The primary functions used here are:
#
# - :py:meth:`pvlib.pvsystem.calcparams_desoto` to estimate the single
#   diode equation parameters at some specified operating conditions.
# - :py:meth:`pvlib.singlediode.bishop88` to calculate the full cell IV curve,
#   including the reverse bias region.
#
# .. note::
#
#     This example requires the reverse bias functionality added in pvlib 0.7.2
#
# .. warning::
#
#     Modeling partial module shading is complicated and depends significantly
#     on the module's electrical topology.  This example makes some simplifying
#     assumptions that are not generally applicable.  For instance, it assumes
#     that shading only applies to beam irradiance (*i.e.* all cells receive
#     the same amount of diffuse irradiance) and cell temperature is uniform
#     and not affected by cell-level irradiance variation.

# Simulating a cell IV curve
# --------------------------
#
# First, calculate IV curves for individual cells.  The process is as follows:
#
# 1) Given a set of cell parameters at reference conditions and the operating
#    conditions of interest (irradiance and temperature), use a single-diode
#    model to calculate the single diode equation parameters for the cell at
#    the operating conditions.  Here we use the De Soto model via
#    :py:func:`pvlib.pvsystem.calcparams_desoto`.
# 2) The single diode equation cannot be solved analytically, so pvlib has
#    implemented a couple methods of solving it for us.  However, currently
#    only the Bishop '88 method (:py:func:`pvlib.singlediode.bishop88`) has
#    the ability to model the reverse bias characteristic in addition to the
#    forward characteristic.  Depending on the nature of the shadow, it is
#    sometimes necessary to model the reverse bias portion of the IV curve,
#    so we use the Bishop '88 method here.  This gives us a set of (V, I)
#    points on the cell's IV curve.

# This figure shows how a cell's current decreases roughly in proportion to

# curve down to lower currents rather than change the curve's shape.

# Combining cell IV curves to create a module IV curve

# in series as well, but with parallel bypass diodes to protect from reverse
# bias voltages.  To add in series, the voltages for a given current are

# might not line up, we align each curve to a common set of current values

# The heatmap makes a few things evident:
#
# - When diffuse fraction is equal to 1, there is no beam irradiance to lose,
#   so shading has no effect on production.
# - When shaded fraction is equal to 0, no irradiance is blocked, so module
#   output does not change with the diffuse fraction.
# - Under sunny conditions (diffuse fraction < 0.5), module output is
#   significantly reduced after just the first cell is shaded
#   (1/12 = ~8% shaded fraction).
