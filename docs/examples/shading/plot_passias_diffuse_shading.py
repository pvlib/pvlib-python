Diffuse Self-Shading
====================

Modeling the reduction in diffuse irradiance caused by row-to-row diffuse
shading.
"""

# %%
# The term "self-shading" usually refers to adjacent rows blocking direct
# irradiance and casting shadows on each other. However, the concept also
# applies to diffuse irradiance because rows block a portion of the sky
# dome even when the sun is high in the sky. The irradiance loss fraction
# depends on how tightly the rows are packed and where on the module the
# loss is evaluated -- a point near the top of edge of a module will see
# more of the sky than a point near the bottom edge.
#
# This example uses the approach presented by Passias and K채llb채ck in [1]_
# and recreates two figures from that paper using
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.masking_angle_passias` and
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.sky_diffuse_passias`.

# First we'll recreate Figure 4, showing how the average masking angle varies
# with array tilt and array packing. The masking angle of a given point on a
# module is the angle from horizontal to the next row's top edge and represents
# the portion of the sky dome blocked by the next row. Because it changes
# from the bottom to the top of a module, the average across the module is
# calculated. In [1]_, ``k`` refers to the ratio of row pitch to row slant
# height (i.e. 1 / GCR).

surface_tilt = np.arange(0, 90, 0.5)

for k in [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10]:
    gcr = 1 / k
    psi = shading.masking_angle_passias(surface_tilt, gcr)
    plt.plot(surface_tilt, psi, label=f"k={k}")

# %%
# So as the array is packed tighter (decreasing ``k``), the average masking
# angle increases.
#
# Next we'll recreate Figure 5. Note that the y-axis here is the ratio of
# diffuse plane of array irradiance (after accounting for shading) to diffuse
# horizontal irradiance. This means that the deviation from 100% is due to the
# combination of self-shading and the fact that being at a tilt blocks off
# the portion of the sky behind the row. The first effect is modeled with
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.sky_diffuse_passias` and the second with
# :py:func:`pvlib.irradiance.isotropic`.

# As ``k`` decreases, GCR increases, so self-shading loss increases and
# collected diffuse irradiance decreases.
