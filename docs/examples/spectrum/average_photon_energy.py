Average Photon Energy Calculation
=================================

Calculation of the Average Photon Energy from SPECTRL2 output.
"""

# %%
# Introduction
# ------------
# This example demonstrates how to use the
# :py:func:`~pvlib.spectrum.average_photon_energy` function to calculate the
# Average Photon Energy (APE, :math:`\overline{E_\gamma}`) of spectral
# irradiance distributions. This example uses spectral irradiance simulated
# using :py:func:`~pvlib.spectrum.spectrl2`, but the same method is
# applicable to spectral irradiance from any source.
# More information on the SPECTRL2 model can be found in [1]_.
# The APE parameter is a useful indicator of the overall shape of the solar
# spectrum [2]_. Higher (lower) APE values indicate a blue (red) shift in the
# spectrum and is one of a variety of such characterisation methods that is
# used in the PV performance literature [3]_.
#
# To demonstrate this functionality, first we will simulate some spectra
# using :py:func:`~pvlib.spectrum.spectrl2`. In this example, we will simulate
# spectra following a similar method to that which is followed in the
# :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_spectrum_plot_spectrl2_fig51A.py` example, which
# reproduces a figure from [4]_. The first step is to import the required
# packages and define some basic system parameters and meteorological
# conditions.

# Spectral simulation
# -------------------------
# With all the necessary inputs now defined, we can model spectral irradiance
# using :py:func:`pvlib.spectrum.spectrl2`. As we are calculating spectra for
# more than one set of conditions, the function will return a dictionary
# containing 2-D arrays for the spectral irradiance components and a 1-D array
# of shape (122,) for wavelength. For each of the 2-D arrays, one dimension is
# for wavelength in nm and one is for irradiance in Wm⁻²nm⁻¹.

# Visualising the spectral data
# -----------------------------
# Let's take a look at the spectral irradiance data simulated hourly for eight
# hours on the first day of 2023.

# Given the changing broadband irradiance throughout the day, it is not obvious
# from inspection how the relative distribution of light changes as a function
# of wavelength. We can normalise the spectral irradiance curves to visualise
# this shift in the shape of the spectrum over the course of the day. In
# this example, we normalise by dividing each spectral irradiance value by the
# total broadband irradiance, which we calculate by integrating the entire
# spectral irradiance distribution with respect to wavelength.

spectral_poa = spectra_components["poa_global"]
wavelength = spectra_components["wavelength"]

broadband_irradiance = trapezoid(spectral_poa, wavelength, axis=0)

labels = [f"{t}, {am_:0.02f}" for t, am_ in zip(time_labels, relative_airmass)]
plt.legend(labels, title="Time, AM")
plt.show()

# %%
# We can now see from the normalised irradiance curves that at the start and
# end of the day, the spectrum is red shifted, meaning there is a greater
# proportion of longer wavelength radiation. Meanwhile, during the middle of
# the day, there is a greater prevalence of shorter wavelength radiation — a
# blue shifted spectrum.
#
# How can we quantify this shift? This is where the average photon energy comes
# into play.

# %%
# Calculating the average photon energy
# -------------------------------------
# To calculate the APE, first we must convert our output spectra from the
# simulation into a compatible input for
# :py:func:`pvlib.spectrum.average_photon_energy`. Since we have more than one
# spectral irradiance distribution, a :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` is
# appropriate. We also need to set the column headers as wavelength, so each
# row is a single spectral irradiance distribution. It is important to remember
# here that the resulting APE values depend on the integration limits, i.e.
# the wavelength range of the spectral irradiance input. APE values are only
# comparable if calculated between the same integration limits. In this case,
# our APE values are calculated between 300nm and 4000nm.

spectra = pd.DataFrame(spectral_poa).T  # convert to dataframe and transpose
spectra.index = time_labels  # add time index
spectra.columns = wavelength  # add wavelength column headers

ape = spectrum.average_photon_energy(spectra)

# %%
# We can update the normalised spectral irradiance plot to include the APE
# value of each spectral irradiance distribution in the legend. Note that the
# units of the APE are electronvolts (eV).

plt.figure()
plt.plot(wavelength, spectral_poa_normalised)
plt.xlim(200, 2700)
plt.ylim(0, 0.0018)
plt.ylabel(r"Normalised Irradiance (nm⁻¹)")
plt.xlabel(r"Wavelength (nm)")
time_labels = times.strftime("%H%M")
labels = [f"{t}, {ape_:0.02f}" for t, ape_ in zip(time_labels, ape)]
plt.legend(labels, title="Time, APE (eV)")
plt.show()

# %%
# As expected, the morning and evening spectra have a lower APE while a higher
# APE is observed closer to the middle of the day. For reference, AM1.5 between
# 300 and 4000 nm is 1.4501 eV. This indicates that the simulated spectra are
# slightly red shifted with respect to the AM1.5 standard reference spectrum.
