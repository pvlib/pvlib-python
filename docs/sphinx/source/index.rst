pvlib python
============

pvlib python is a community developed toolbox that provides a set of
functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic
energy systems and accomplishing related tasks.
The core mission of pvlib python is to provide open,
reliable, interoperable, and benchmark implementations of PV system models.

The source code for pvlib python is hosted on `GitHub
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python>`_.
Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

For examples of how to use pvlib python, please see
:ref:`package_overview` and the :ref:`example_gallery`.
The documentation assumes general familiarity with
Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Google searches will yield many
excellent tutorials for these packages.

The pvlib python GitHub wiki has a `Projects and publications that use
pvlib python
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Projects-and-publications-
that-use-pvlib-python>`_ page for inspiration and listing of your
application.

There is a :ref:`variable naming convention <nomenclature>` to
ensure consistency throughout the library.


History and acknowledgement
===========================

pvlib python began in 2013 as a Python translation of the `PVLIB for Matlab <https://github.com/sandialabs/MATLAB_PV_LIB>`_
toolbox developed by Sandia National Laboratories. pvlib python has grown substantially since then.
Today it contains code contributions from over a hundred individuals worldwide
and is maintained by a core group of PV modelers from a variety of institutions.

pvlib has been supported directly and indirectly by DOE, NumFOCUS, and
Google Summer of Code funding, university research projects,
companies that allow their employees to contribute, and from personal time.
