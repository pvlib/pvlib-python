pvlib-python
========================================

pvlib-python provides a set of documented functions for simulating the
performance of photovoltaic energy systems. The toolbox was originally
developed in MATLAB at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements
many of the models and methods developed at the Labs. More information
on Sandia Labs PV performance modeling programs can be found at
https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/.

The source code for pvlib-python is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

For examples of how to use pvlib-python, please see
:ref:`package_overview` and our `Jupyter Notebook tutorials
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pvlib/pvlib-python/tree/master/docs/
tutorials/>`_. The documentation assumes general familiarity with
Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Google searches will yield many
excellent tutorials for these packages.

The pvlib-python GitHub wiki has a `Projects and publications that use
pvlib python
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Projects-and-publications-
that-use-pvlib-python>`_ page for inspiration and listing of your
application.

There is a :ref:`variable naming convention <variables_style_rules>` to
ensure consistency throughout the library.
