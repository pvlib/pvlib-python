IO Tools
========

Functions for retrieving, reading, and writing data from a variety
of sources and file formats relevant to solar energy modeling.  See also
:ref:`weatherdata`.

Gridded solar resource data
---------------------------

Modeled irradiance and meteorological data, available for large regions of
the world.

Public datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These APIs are free to access, although some require registration.
