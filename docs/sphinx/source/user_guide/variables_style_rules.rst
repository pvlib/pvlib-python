Variables and Symbols
=====================

There is a convention on consistent variable names throughout the library:

.. csv-table:: List of used Variables and Parameters
   :file: ../../../../pvlib/data/variables_style_rules.csv
   :delim: ;
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 5, 5
   :stub-columns: 1
   
For a definition and further explanation on the variables, common symbols and units refer to the following sources:
