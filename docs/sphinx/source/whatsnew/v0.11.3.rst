  (:pull:`2352`)

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* To ensure that the time zone in pvlib.location.Location remains internally
  consistent if/when the time zone is updated, the tz attribute becomes the
  single source of time-zone truth, is the single time-zone setter interface,
  and its getter consistently returns an IANA string. datetime.tzinfo
  subclasses (including time zones from pytz and zoneinfo) are still fully
  supported in the tz setter, but the pytz attribute becomes read only.
