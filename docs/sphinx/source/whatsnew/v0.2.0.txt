This is a major release from 0.1 and includes a small number of API changes,
several new features and enhancements along with a number of bug fixes.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.


API changes

  to ``irradiance.py`` (:issue:`42`)
* Mark some ``pvsystem.py`` methods as private (:issue:`20`)
* Change variable names to conform with new
  `Variables and style rules wiki <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Variables-and-style-rules>`_
  (:issue:`37`, :issue:`54`).
