v0.4.0 (July xx, 2016)
-----------------------

This is a major release from 0.3.3. We recommend that all users upgrade
to this version after reviewing the API Changes. Please see the Bug
Fixes for changes that will result in slightly different modeling
results.


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove unneeded module argument from singlediode function. (:issue:`200`)
* In ``pvlib.irradiance.perez``, renamed argument ``modelt`` to ``model``.
  (:issue:`196`)
* Functions in the irradiance module now work with scalar inputs
  in addition to arrays and Series. Furthermore, these functions no
  longer promote scalar or array input to Series output.
  Also applies to atmosphere.relativeairmass. (:issue:`201`, :issue:`214`)
* The irradiance.extraradiation function input/output type consistency
  across different methods has been dramatically improved.
  (:issue:`217`, :issue:`219`)
* Updated to pvsystem.sapm to be consistent with the PVLIB MATLAB API.
  pvsystem.sapm now takes an effective irradiance argument instead of
  POA irradiances, airmass, and AOI. Implements closely related
  sapm_spectral_loss, sapm_aoi_loss, and sapm_effective_irradiance
  functions, as well as PVSystem methods. The sapm_aoi_loss function
  includes an optional argument to apply an upper limit to the output
  (output can be ~1% larger than 1 for AOI of ~30 degrees).
  (:issue:`198`, :issue:`205`, :issue:`218`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds the First Solar spectral correction model. (:issue:`115`)
* Adds the Gueymard 1994 integrated precipitable water model. (:issue:`115`)
* Adds the PVWatts DC, AC, and system losses model. (:issue:`195`)
* Improve PEP8 conformity in irradiance module. (:issue:`214`)
* irradiance.disc is up to 10x faster. (:issue:`214`)
* Add solarposition.nrel_earthsun_distance function and option to
  calculate extraterrestrial radiation using the NREL solar position
  algorithm. (:issue:`211`, :issue:`215`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* dirint function yielded the wrong results for non-sea-level pressures.
  Fixed. (:issue:`212`)
* Fixed a bug in the day angle calculation used by the 'spencer' and 'asce'
  extraterrestrial radiation options. Most modeling results will be changed
  by less than 1 part in 1000. (:issue:`211`)
* irradiance.extraradiation now raises a ValueError for invalid method
  input. It previously failed silently. (:issue:`215`)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added new terms to the variables documentation. (:issue:`195`)
* Added clear sky documentation page.
* Fix documentation build warnings. (:issue:`210`)
* Removed an unneeded note in irradiance.extraradiation. (:issue:`216`)


Other
~~~~~

* pvlib-python is now available on the conda-forge channel:
  conda install pvlib-python -c conda-forge (:issue:`154`)
* Switch to the py.test testing framework. (:issue:`204`)
* Reconfigure Appveyor CI builds and resolve an issue in which the command
  line length was too long. (:issue:`207`)
* Manually build numpy and pandas for the min requirements test.
  This is needed to avoid Continuum's bad practice of bundling scipy
  with pandas. (:issue:`214`)


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* pvlib now requires pandas >= 0.14.0 and numpy >= 1.9.0, both
  released in 2014. Most of pvlib will work with lesser versions.
  (:issue:`214`)
