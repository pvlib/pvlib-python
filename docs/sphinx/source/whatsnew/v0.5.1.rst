v0.5.1 (?, 2017)
------------------------

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
*

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Remove condition causing Overflow warning from clearsky.haurwitz
* modelchain.basic_chain now correctly passes 'solar_position_method'
  arg to solarposition.get_solarposition
* Unnecessary calculations of alpha_prime was removed from two methods of spa.py

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Improve clearsky.lookup_linke_turbidity speed. (:issue:`368`)
* Ideal devices supported in single diode model, e.g.,
  resistance_series = 0 and/or resistance_shunt = numpy.inf (:issue:`340`)
* `pvsystem.v_from_i` and `pvsystem.i_from_v` computations for near ideal
  devices are more numerically stable. However, very, very near ideal
  resistance_series and/or resistance_shunt may still cause issues with the
  implicit solver (:issue:`340`)

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* `pvsystem.v_from_i` and `pvsystem.i_from_v` functions now accept
  resistance_series = 0 and/or resistance_shunt = numpy.inf as inputs
  (:issue:`340`)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Doc string of modelchain.basic_chain was updated to describe args
  more accurately
* Doc strings of `singlediode`, `pvsystem.v_from_i`, and `pvsystem.i_from_v`
  were updated to describe acceptable input arg ranges

Testing
~~~~~~~
* Changed test for clearsky.haurwitz to operate on zenith angles
* Significant new test cases added for `pvsystem.v_from_i` and
  `pvsystem.i_from_v` (:issue:`340`)
