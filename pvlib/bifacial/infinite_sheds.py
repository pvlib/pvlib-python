    Parameters
    ----------
    f_x : numeric
        Fraction of row slant height from the bottom that is shaded from
        direct irradiance. [unitless]
    surface_tilt : numeric
        Surface tilt angle in degrees from horizontal, e.g., surface facing up

    npoints : int, default 100

    A detailed calculation would be

        dhi * (f_x * vf_shade_sky_integ + (1 - f_x) * vf_noshade_sky_integ)

    (the shaded portion). But the average view factor is

        1/(f_x - 0) Integral_0^f_x vf(x) dx

    r"""
    Calculate plane-of-array (POA) irradiance on one side of a row of modules.

    The infinite sheds model [1] assumes the PV system comprises parallel,
    evenly spaced rows on a level, horizontal surface. Rows can be on fixed
    racking or single axis trackers. The model calculates irradiance at a
    location far from the ends of any rows, in effect, assuming that the
    rows (sheds) are infinitely long.

    POA irradiance components include direct, diffuse and global (total).
    Irradiance values are reduced to account for reflection of direct light,
    but are not adjusted for solar spectrum or reduced by a module's
    bifaciality factor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    surface_tilt : numeric
        Tilt of the surface from horizontal. Must be between 0 and 180. For
        example, for a fixed tilt module mounted at 30 degrees from
        horizontal, use ``surface_tilt=30`` to get front-side irradiance and
        ``surface_tilt=150`` to get rear-side irradiance. [degree]

    surface_azimuth : numeric
        Surface azimuth in decimal degrees east of north
        (e.g. North = 0, South = 180, East = 90, West = 270). [degree]

    solar_zenith : numeric
        Refraction-corrected solar zenith. [degree]

    solar_azimuth : numeric
        Solar azimuth. [degree]

    gcr : float
        Ground coverage ratio, ratio of row slant length to row spacing.
        [unitless]

    height : float
        Height of the center point of the row above the ground; must be in the
        same units as ``pitch``.

    pitch : float
        Distance between two rows; must be in the same units as ``height``.

    ghi : numeric
        Global horizontal irradiance. [W/m2]

    dhi : numeric
        Diffuse horizontal irradiance. [W/m2]

    dni : numeric
        Direct normal irradiance. [W/m2]

    albedo : numeric
        Surface albedo. [unitless]

    model : str, default 'isotropic'
        Irradiance model - can be one of 'isotropic' or 'haydavies'.

    dni_extra : numeric, optional
        Extraterrestrial direct normal irradiance. Required when
        ``model='haydavies'``. [W/m2]

    iam : numeric, default 1.0
        Incidence angle modifier, the fraction of direct irradiance incident
        on the surface that is not reflected away. [unitless]

    npoints : int, default 100
        Number of discretization points for calculating integrated view
        factors.

    vectorize : bool, default False
        If True, vectorize the view factor calculation across ``surface_tilt``.
        This increases speed with the cost of increased memory usage.

    Returns
    -------
    output : dict or DataFrame
        Output is a DataFrame when input ghi is a Series. See Notes for
        descriptions of content.

    Notes
    -----
    Input parameters ``height`` and ``pitch`` must have the same unit.

    ``output`` always includes:

    - ``poa_global`` : total POA irradiance. [W/m^2]
    - ``poa_diffuse`` : total diffuse POA irradiance from all sources. [W/m^2]
    - ``poa_direct`` : total direct POA irradiance. [W/m^2]
    - ``poa_sky_diffuse`` : total sky diffuse irradiance on the plane of array.
      [W/m^2]
    - ``poa_ground_diffuse`` : total ground-reflected diffuse irradiance on the
      plane of array. [W/m^2]
    - ``shaded_fraction`` : fraction of row slant height from the bottom that
      is shaded from direct irradiance by adjacent rows. [unitless]

    Get front and rear irradiance using the infinite sheds model.

    The infinite sheds model [1] assumes the PV system comprises parallel,
    evenly spaced rows on a level, horizontal surface. Rows can be on fixed
    racking or single axis trackers. The model calculates irradiance at a
    location far from the ends of any rows, in effect, assuming that the
    rows (sheds) are infinitely long.

    The model accounts for the following effects:

    - restricted view of the sky from module surfaces due to the nearby rows.
    - restricted view of the ground from module surfaces due to nearby rows.
    - restricted view of the sky from the ground due to rows.
    - shading of module surfaces by nearby rows.
    - shading of rear cells of a module by mounting structure and by
      module features.

    The model implicitly assumes that diffuse irradiance from the sky is
    isotropic, and that module surfaces do not allow irradiance to transmit
    through the module to the ground through gaps between cells.
