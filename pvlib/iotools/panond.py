    Retrieve Module or Inverter data from a .pan or .ond text file,

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or path object
        Name or path of a .pan/.ond file

    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding of the file.  Some files may require specifying
        ``encoding='utf-8-sig'`` to import correctly.

    Returns
    -------
    content : dict
        Contents of the .pan or .ond file following the indentation of the
        file. The value of datatypes are assumed during reading. The value
        units are the default used by PVsyst.

    Notes
    -----
    The parser is intended for use with .pan and .ond files that were created
    for use by PVsyst. At time of publication, no documentation for these
    files was available. So, this parser is based on inferred logic, rather
    than anything specified by PVsyst.  At time of creation, tested
    .pan/.ond files used UTF-8 encoding.

    The parser assumes that the file being parsed uses indentation of two
    spaces ('  ') to create a new level in a nested dictionary, and that
    key/values pairs of interest are separated using '='. This further means
    that lines not containing '=' are omitted from the final returned
    dictionary.

    Additionally, the indented lines often contain values themselves. This
    leads to a conflict with the .pan/.ond file and the ability of nested a
    dictionary to capture that information. The solution implemented here is
    to repeat that key to the new nested dictionary within that new level.

    The parser takes an additional step to infer the datatype present in
    each value. The .pan/.ond files appear to have intentially left datatype
    indicators (e.g. floats have '.' decimals). However, there is still the
    possibility that the datatype applied from this parser is incorrect. In
    that event the user would need to convert to the desired datatype.
