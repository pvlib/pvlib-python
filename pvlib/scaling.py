    Compute spatial aggregation time series smoothing on clear sky index based
    on the Wavelet Variability model.

    This model is described in Lave et al. [1]_, [2]_.
    Implementation is basically a port of the Matlab version of the code [3]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series
        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.

    positions : numeric
        Array of coordinate distances as (x,y) pairs representing the
        easting, northing of the site positions in meters [m]. Distributed
        plants could be simulated by gridded points throughout the plant
        footprint.

    cloud_speed : numeric
        Speed of cloud movement in meters per second [m/s].

    dt : float, optional
        The time series time delta. By default, is inferred from the
        clearsky_index. Must be specified for a time series that doesn't
        include an index. Units of seconds [s].

    Returns
    -------
    smoothed : numeric or pandas.Series
        The Clear Sky Index time series smoothed for the described plant.

    wavelet: numeric
        The individual wavelets for the time series before smoothing.

    tmscales: numeric
        The timescales associated with the wavelets in seconds [s].

    Convert latitude and longitude in degrees to a coordinate system measured

    This is a convenience method to support inputs to wvm. Note that the

    longer distances, users should consider use of Universal Transverse
    Mercator (UTM) or other suitable cartographic projection. Consider
    packages built for cartographic projection such as pyproj (e.g.
    pyproj.transform()) [2].

    ----------

    coordinates : numeric
        Array or list of (latitude, longitude) coordinate pairs. Use decimal
        degrees notation.
