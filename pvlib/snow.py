def dc_loss_nrel(snow_coverage, num_strings):
    '''
    Calculates the fraction of DC capacity lost due to snow coverage.

    DC capacity loss assumes that if a string is partially covered by snow,
    the string's capacity is lost; see [1]_, Eq. 11.8.

    Module orientation is accounted for by specifying the number of cell
    strings in parallel along the slant height.
    For example, a typical 60-cell module has 3 parallel strings, each
    comprising 20 cells in series, with the cells arranged in 6 columns of 10
    cells each. For a row consisting of single modules, if the module is
    mounted in portrait orientation, i.e., the row slant height is along a
    column of 10 cells, there is 1 string in parallel along the row slant
    height, so `num_strings=1`. In contrast, if the module is mounted in
    landscape orientation with the row slant height comprising 6 cells, there
    are 3 parallel strings along the row slant height, so `num_strings=3`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    snow_coverage : numeric
        The fraction of row slant height covered by snow at each time step.

    num_strings: int
        The number of parallel-connected strings along a row slant height.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : numeric
        fraction of DC capacity loss due to snow coverage at each time step.

    Calculates monthly snow loss based on the Townsend monthly snow loss
    model.

    This model is described in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    snow_total : array-like
        Snow received each month. Referred to as S in [1]_. [cm]

    snow_events : array-like
        Number of snowfall events each month. Snow events are defined as days
        in the month that have snowfall greater than 1 inch. May be int or
        float type for the average events in a typical month. Referred to as N
        in [1]_.

    surface_tilt : float
        Tilt angle of the array. [deg]

    relative_humidity : array-like
        Monthly average relative humidity. [%]

    temp_air : array-like
        Monthly average ambient temperature. [C]

    poa_global : array-like
        Monthly plane of array insolation. [Wh/m2]

    slant_height : float
        Row length in the slanted plane of array dimension. [m]

    lower_edge_height : float
        Distance from array lower edge to the ground. [m]

    string_factor : float, default 1.0
        Multiplier applied to monthly loss fraction. Use 1.0 if the DC array
        has only one string of modules in the slant direction, use 0.75
        otherwise. [-]

    angle_of_repose : float, default 40
        Piled snow angle, assumed to stabilize at 40°, the midpoint of
        25°-55° avalanching slope angles. [deg]

    Returns
    -------
    loss : array-like
        Monthly average DC capacity loss fraction due to snow coverage.

    Notes
    -----
    This model has not been validated for tracking arrays; however, for
    tracking arrays [1]_ suggests using the maximum rotation angle in place
    of ``surface_tilt``. The author of [1]_ recommends using one-half the
    table width for ``slant_height``, i.e., the distance from the tracker
    axis to the module edge.

    The parameter `string_factor` is an enhancement added to the model after
    publication of [1]_ per private communication with the model's author. The
    definition for snow events documented above is also based on private
    communication with the model's author.
