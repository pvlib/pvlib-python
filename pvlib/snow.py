def dc_loss_nrel(snow_coverage, num_strings):
    """
    Calculates the fraction of DC capacity lost due to snow coverage.

    DC capacity loss assumes that if a string is partially covered by snow,
    the string's capacity is lost; see [1]_, Eq. 11.8.

    Module orientation is accounted for by specifying the number of cell
    strings in parallel along the slant height.
    For example, a typical 60-cell module has 3 parallel strings, each
    comprising 20 cells in series, with the cells arranged in 6 columns of 10
    cells each. For a row consisting of single modules, if the module is
    mounted in portrait orientation, i.e., the row slant height is along a
    column of 10 cells, there is 1 string in parallel along the row slant
    height, so `num_strings=1`. In contrast, if the module is mounted in
    landscape orientation with the row slant height comprising 6 cells, there
    are 3 parallel strings along the row slant height, so `num_strings=3`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    snow_coverage : numeric
        The fraction of row slant height covered by snow at each time step.

    num_strings: int
        The number of parallel-connected strings along a row slant height.

    Parameters
    ----------
    snow_total : array-like
        Snow received each month. Referred to as S in [1]_. [cm]

    snow_events : array-like

    surface_tilt : float
        Tilt angle of the array. [deg]

    relative_humidity : array-like
        Monthly average relative humidity. [%]

    temp_air : array-like

    lower_edge_height : float

    string_factor : float, default 1.0
        Multiplier applied to monthly loss fraction. Use 1.0 if the DC array
        has only one string of modules in the slant direction, use 0.75
        otherwise. [-]

    angle_of_repose : float, default 40
        Piled snow angle, assumed to stabilize at 40°, the midpoint of
        25°-55° avalanching slope angles. [deg]

    Returns
    -------
    loss : array-like
        Monthly average DC capacity loss fraction due to snow coverage.

    Notes
    -----
    This model has not been validated for tracking arrays; however, for
    tracking arrays [1]_ suggests using the maximum rotation angle in place
    of ``surface_tilt``. The author of [1]_ recommends using one-half the
    table width for ``slant_height``, i.e., the distance from the tracker
    axis to the module edge.

    The parameter `string_factor` is an enhancement added to the model after
    publication of [1]_ per private communication with the model's author. The
    definition for snow events documented above is also based on private
    communication with the model's author.
