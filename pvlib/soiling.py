    Calculates soiling ratio given particulate and rain data using the
    Fixed Velocity model from Humboldt State University (HSU).

    The HSU soiling model [1]_ returns the soiling ratio, a value between zero
    and one which is equivalent to (1 - transmission loss). Therefore a soiling
    ratio of 1.0 is equivalent to zero transmission loss.

    Parameters
    ----------

    rainfall : Series
        Rain accumulated in each time period. [mm]

    cleaning_threshold : float
        Amount of rain in an accumulation period needed to clean the PV
        modules. [mm]

    surface_tilt : numeric
        Tilt of the PV panels from horizontal. [degree]

    pm2_5 : numeric
        Concentration of airborne particulate matter (PM) with
        aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns. [g/m^3]

    pm10 : numeric
        Concentration of airborne particulate matter (PM) with
        aerodynamicdiameter less than 10 microns. [g/m^3]

    depo_veloc : dict, default {'2_5': 0.0009, '10': 0.004}
        Deposition or settling velocity of particulates. [m/s]

    rain_accum_period : Timedelta, default 1 hour
        Period for accumulating rainfall to check against `cleaning_threshold`
        It is recommended that `rain_accum_period` be between 1 hour and
        24 hours.

    Returns
    -------
    soiling_ratio : Series
        Values between 0 and 1. Equal to 1 - transmission loss.

    """
    Calculates fraction of energy lost due to soiling given rainfall data and
    daily loss rate using the Kimber model.

    Kimber soiling model [1]_ assumes soiling builds up at a daily rate unless
    the daily rainfall is greater than a threshold. The model also assumes that
    if daily rainfall has exceeded the threshold within a grace period, then
    the ground is too damp to cause soiling build-up. The model also assumes
    there is a maximum soiling build-up. Scheduled manual washes and rain
    events are assumed to reset soiling to zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rainfall: pandas.Series
        Accumulated rainfall at the end of each time period. [mm]
    cleaning_threshold: float, default 6
        Amount of daily rainfall required to clean the panels. [mm]
    soiling_loss_rate: float, default 0.0015
        Fraction of energy lost due to one day of soiling. [unitless]
    grace_period : int, default 14
        Number of days after a rainfall event when it's assumed the ground is
        damp, and so it's assumed there is no soiling. [days]
    max_soiling : float, default 0.3
        Maximum fraction of energy lost due to soiling. Soiling will build up
        until this value. [unitless]
    manual_wash_dates : sequence, optional
        List or tuple of dates as Python ``datetime.date`` when the panels were
        washed manually. Note there is no grace period after a manual wash, so
        soiling begins to build up immediately.
    initial_soiling : float, default 0
        Initial fraction of energy lost due to soiling at time zero in the
        `rainfall` series input. [unitless]
    rain_accum_period : int, default 24
        Period for accumulating rainfall to check against `cleaning_threshold`.
        The Kimber model defines this period as one day. [hours]

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        fraction of energy lost due to soiling, has same intervals as input

    Notes
    -----
    The soiling loss rate depends on both the geographical region and the
    soiling environment type. Rates measured by Kimber [1]_ are summarized in
    the following table:

    ===================  =======  =========  ======================
    Region/Environment   Rural    Suburban   Urban/Highway/Airport
    ===================  =======  =========  ======================
    Central Valley       0.0011   0.0019     0.0020
    Northern CA          0.0011   0.0010     0.0016
    Southern CA          0        0.0016     0.0019
    Desert               0.0030   0.0030     0.0030
    ===================  =======  =========  ======================

    Rainfall thresholds and grace periods may also vary by region. Please
    consult [1]_ for more information.
