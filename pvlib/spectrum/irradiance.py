def get_am15g(wavelength=None):
    r"""
    Read the ASTM G173-03 AM1.5 global spectrum on a 37-degree tilted surface,
    optionally interpolated to the specified wavelength(s).

    Global (tilted) irradiance includes direct and diffuse irradiance from sky
    and ground reflections, and is more formally called hemispherical
    irradiance (on a tilted surface).  In the context of photovoltaic systems
    the irradiance on a flat receiver is frequently called plane-of-array (POA)
    irradiance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelength: 1-D sequence of numeric, optional
        Wavelengths at which the spectrum is interpolated.
        By default the 2002 wavelengths of the standard are returned. [nm].

    Returns
    -------
    am15g: pandas.Series
        The AM1.5g standard spectrum indexed by ``wavelength``. [W/(m²nm)].

    Notes
    -----
    If ``wavelength`` is specified this function uses linear interpolation.

    If the values in ``wavelength`` are too widely spaced, the integral of the
    spectrum may deviate from the standard value of 1000.37 W/m².

    The values in the data file provided with pvlib-python are copied from an
    Excel file distributed by NREL, which is found here:
    https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/assets/data/astmg173.xls

def get_reference_spectra(wavelengths=None, standard="ASTM G173-03"):
    r"""
    Read a standard spectrum specified by ``standard``, optionally
    interpolated to the specified wavelength(s).

    Defaults to ``ASTM G173-03`` AM1.5 standard [1]_, which returns
    ``extraterrestrial``, ``global`` and ``direct`` spectrum on a 37-degree
    tilted surface, optionally interpolated to the specified wavelength(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelengths : numeric, optional
        Wavelengths at which the spectrum is interpolated. [nm].
        If not provided, the original wavelengths from the specified standard
        are used. Values outside that range are filled with zeros.

    standard : str, default "ASTM G173-03"
        The reference standard to be read. Only the reference
        ``"ASTM G173-03"`` is available at the moment.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_spectra : pandas.DataFrame
        The standard spectrum by ``wavelength [nm]``. [W/(m²nm)].
        Column names are ``extraterrestrial``, ``direct`` and ``global``.

    Notes
    -----
    If ``wavelength`` is specified, linear interpolation is used.

    If the values in ``wavelength`` are too widely spaced, the integral of each
    spectrum may deviate from its standard value.
    For global spectra, it is about 1000.37 W/m².

def average_photon_energy(spectra):
    r"""
    Calculate the average photon energy of one or more spectral irradiance
    distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spectra : pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame

        Spectral irradiance, must be positive. [Wm⁻²nm⁻¹]

        A single spectrum must be a :py:class:`pandas.Series` with wavelength
        [nm] as the index, while multiple spectra must be rows in a
        :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` with column headers as wavelength [nm].

    Returns
    -------
    ape : numeric or pandas.Series
        Average Photon Energy [eV].
        Note: returns ``np.nan`` in the case of all-zero spectral irradiance
        input.

    Notes
    -----
    The average photon energy (APE) is an index used to characterise the solar
    spectrum. It has been used widely in the physics literature since the
    1900s, but its application for solar spectral irradiance characterisation
    in the context of PV performance modelling was proposed in 2002 [1]_. The
    APE is calculated based on the principle that a photon's energy is
    inversely proportional to its wavelength:

    .. math::

        E_\gamma = \frac{hc}{\lambda},

    where :math:`E_\gamma` is the energy of a photon with wavelength
    :math:`\lambda`, :math:`h` is the Planck constant, and :math:`c` is the
    speed of light. Therefore, the average energy of all photons within a
    single spectral irradiance distribution provides an indication of the
    general shape of the spectrum. A higher average photon energy
    (shorter wavelength) indicates a blue-shifted spectrum, while a lower
    average photon energy (longer wavelength) would indicate a red-shifted
    spectrum. This value of the average photon energy can be calculated by
    dividing the total energy in the spectrum by the total number of photons
    in the spectrum as follows [1]_:

    .. math::

        \overline{E_\gamma} = \frac{1}{q} \cdot \frac{\int G(\lambda) \,
                                                       d\lambda}
        {\int \Phi(\lambda) \, d\lambda}.

    :math:`\Phi(\lambda)` is the photon flux density as a function of
    wavelength, :math:`G(\lambda)` is the spectral irradiance, :math:`q` is the
    elementary charge used here so that the average photon energy,
    :math:`\overline{E_\gamma}`, is expressed in electronvolts (eV). The
    integrals are computed over the full wavelength range of the ``spectra``
    parameter.
