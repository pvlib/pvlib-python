    """
    Calculate spectral mismatch between a test device and broadband reference
    device under specified solar spectral irradiance conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sr: pandas.Series
        The relative spectral response of one (photovoltaic) test device.
        The index of the Series must contain wavelength values in nm. [-]

    e_sun: pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        One or more measured solar irradiance spectra in a pandas.DataFrame

        be given as a pandas.Series having wavelength in nm as index.
        [(W/m^2)/nm]

    e_ref: pandas.Series, optional
        The reference spectrum to use for the mismatch calculation.
        The index of the Series must contain wavelength values in nm.
        The default is the ASTM G173-03 global tilted spectrum. [(W/m^2)/nm]

    Returns
    -------
    smm: pandas.Series or float if a single measured spectrum is provided. [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Measured solar spectral irradiance usually covers a wavelength range
    that is smaller than the range considered as broadband irradiance.
    The infrared limit for the former typically lies around 1100 or 1600 nm,
    whereas the latter extends to around 2800 or 4000 nm.  To avoid imbalance
    between the magnitudes of the integrated spectra (the broadband values)
    this function truncates the reference spectrum to the same range as the
    measured (or simulated) field spectra. The assumption implicit in this
    truncation is that the energy in the unmeasured wavelength range
    is the same fraction of the broadband energy for both the measured
    spectra and the reference spectrum.

    If the default reference spectrum is used it is linearly interpolated
    to the wavelengths of the measured spectrum, but if a reference spectrum
    is provided via the parameter ``e_ref`` it is used without change. This
    makes it possible to avoid interpolation, or to use a different method of
    interpolation, or to avoid truncation.

    The spectral response is linearly interpolated to the wavelengths of each
    spectrum with which is it multiplied internally (``e_sun`` and ``e_ref``).
    If the wavelengths of the spectral response already match one or both
    of these spectra interpolation has no effect; therefore, another type of
    interpolation could be used to process ``sr`` before calling this function.

    The standards describing mismatch calculations focus on indoor laboratory
    applications, but are applicable to outdoor performance as well.
    The 2016 version of ASTM E973 [1]_ is somewhat more difficult to
    read than the 2010 version [2]_ because it includes adjustments for
    the temperature dependency of spectral response, which led to a
    formulation using quantum efficiency (QE).
    IEC 60904-7 is clearer and also discusses the use of a broadband
    reference device. [3]_

    Spectral mismatch modifier based on precipitable water and absolute
    (pressure-adjusted) air mass.

    Estimates the spectral mismatch modifier, :math:`M`, representing the
    effect of variation in the spectral irradiance on the module short circuit
    current :math:`M`  is estimated from absolute (pressure-corrected) air
    mass, :math:`AM_a`, and precipitable water, :math:`Pw`.

    Default coefficients are determined for several cell types with
    known quantum efficiency curves, by using the Simple Model of the
    Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) [1]_. Using
    SMARTS, spectrums are simulated with all combinations of AMa and
    Pw where:

    * :math:`0.5 \textrm{cm} <= Pw <= 5 \textrm{cm}`
    * :math:`1.0 <= AM_a <= 5.0`
    * Spectral range is limited to that of CMP11 (280 nm to 2800 nm)
    * Spectrum simulated on an equatorial facing surface with 37Â° tilt
    * All other parameters fixed at G173 standard

    From these simulated spectra, :math:`M` is calculated using the known
    quantum efficiency curves. Multiple linear regression is then
    applied to fit Eq. 1 to determine the coefficients for each module. More
    details on the model can be found in [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    precipitable_water : numeric
        atmospheric precipitable water. [cm]

    airmass_absolute : numeric
        absolute (pressure-adjusted) air mass. [unitless]

    module_type : str, optional
        a string specifying a cell type. Values of 'cdte', 'monosi', 'xsi',
        'multisi', and 'polysi' (can be lower or upper case). If provided,
        module_type selects default coefficients for the following modules:

        * ``'cdte'`` - First Solar Series 4-2 CdTe module.
        * ``'monosi'``, ``'xsi'`` - First Solar TetraSun module.
        * ``'multisi'``, ``'polysi'`` - anonymous multi-crystalline silicon
          module.
        * ``'cigs'`` - anonymous copper indium gallium selenide module.
        * ``'asi'`` - anonymous amorphous silicon module.

        The module used to calculate the spectral correction
        coefficients corresponds to the Multi-crystalline silicon
        Manufacturer 2 Model C from [3]_. The spectral response (SR) of CIGS
        and a-Si modules used to derive coefficients can be found in [4]_

    coefficients : array-like, optional
        Allows for entry of user-defined spectral correction
        coefficients. Coefficients must be of length 6. Derivation of
        coefficients requires use of SMARTS and PV module quantum
        efficiency curve. Useful for modeling PV module types which are
        not included as defaults, or to fine tune the spectral
        correction to a particular PV module. Note that the parameters for
        modules with very similar quantum efficiency should be similar,
        in most cases limiting the need for module specific coefficients.

    min_precipitable_water : float, default 0.1
        minimum atmospheric precipitable water. Any ``precipitable_water``
        value lower than ``min_precipitable_water``
        is set to ``min_precipitable_water``. [cm]

    max_precipitable_water : float, default 8
        maximum atmospheric precipitable water. Any ``precipitable_water``
        value greater than ``max_precipitable_water``
        is set to ``np.nan``. [cm]

    min_airmass_absolute : float, default 0.58
        minimum absolute airmass. Any ``airmass_absolute`` value lower than
        ``min_airmass_absolute`` is set to ``min_airmass_absolute``. [unitless]

    max_airmass_absolute : float, default 10
        minimum absolute airmass. Any ``airmass_absolute`` value greater than
        ``max_airmass_absolute`` is set to ``max_airmass_absolute``. [unitless]

    Returns
    -------
    modifier: array-like
        spectral mismatch factor (unitless) which can be multiplied
        with broadband irradiance reaching a module's cells to estimate
        effective irradiance, i.e., the irradiance that is converted to
        electrical current.

    Notes
    ----
    The ``spectral_factor_firstsolar`` model takes the following form:

    .. math::

        M = c_1 + c_2 AM_a  + c_3 Pw  + c_4 AM_a^{0.5}
            + c_5 Pw^{0.5} + c_6 \frac{AM_a} {Pw^{0.5}}.

    The default values for the limits applied to :math:`AM_a` and :math:`Pw`
    via the ``min_precipitable_water``, ``max_precipitable_water``,
    ``min_airmass_absolute``, and ``max_airmass_absolute`` are set to prevent
    divergence of the model presented above. These default values were
    determined by the publication authors in the original pvlib-python
    implementation (:pull:`208`).

def spectral_factor_pvspec(

):
    r"""
    Estimate a technology-specific spectral mismatch modifier from absolute
    airmass and clear sky index using the PVSPEC model.

    The PVSPEC spectral mismatch model includes the effects of cloud cover on
    the irradiance spectrum. Model coefficients are derived using spectral
    irradiance and other meteorological data from eight locations. Coefficients
    for six module types are available via the ``module_type`` parameter.
    More details on the model can be found in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    airmass_absolute : numeric
        absolute (pressure-adjusted) airmass. [unitless]

    clearsky_index: numeric
        clear sky index. [unitless]

    module_type : str, optional
        One of the following PV technology strings from [1]_:

        * ``'fs4-1'`` - First Solar series 4-1 and earlier CdTe module.
        * ``'fs4-2'`` - First Solar 4-2 and later CdTe module.
        * ``'monosi'`` - anonymous monocrystalline Si module.
        * ``'multisi'`` - anonymous multicrystalline Si module.
        * ``'cigs'`` - anonymous copper indium gallium selenide module.
        * ``'asi'`` - anonymous amorphous silicon module.

    coefficients : array-like, optional
        user-defined coefficients, if not using one of the default coefficient
        sets via the ``module_type`` parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    mismatch: numeric
        spectral mismatch factor (unitless) which is multiplied
        with broadband irradiance reaching a module's cells to estimate
        effective irradiance, i.e., the irradiance that is converted to
        electrical current.

    Notes
    -----
    The PVSPEC model parameterises the spectral mismatch factor as a function
    of absolute air mass and the clear sky index as follows:

    .. math::

        M = a_1 k_c^{a_2} AM_a^{a_3},

    where :math:`M` is the spectral mismatch factor, :math:`k_c` is the clear
    sky index, :math:`AM_a` is the absolute air mass, and :math:`a_1, a_2, a_3`
    are module-specific coefficients. In the PVSPEC model publication, absolute
    air mass (denoted as :math:`AM`) is estimated starting from the Kasten and
    Young relative air mass [2]_. The clear sky index, which is the ratio of
    GHI to clear sky GHI, uses the ESRA model [3]_ to estimate the clear sky
    GHI with monthly Linke turbidity values from [4]_ as inputs.

):
    r"""
    Estimate a technology-specific spectral mismatch modifier from
    airmass and clear sky index using the JRC model.

    The JRC spectral mismatch model includes the effects of cloud cover on
    the irradiance spectrum. Model coefficients are derived using measurements
    of irradiance and module performance at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in
    Ispra, Italy (45.80N, 8.62E). Coefficients for two module types are
    available via the ``module_type`` parameter. More details on the model can
    be found in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    airmass : numeric
        relative airmass. [unitless]

    clearsky_index: numeric
        clear sky index. [unitless]

    module_type : str, optional
        One of the following PV technology strings from [1]_:

        * ``'cdte'`` - anonymous CdTe module.
        * ``'multisi'`` - anonymous multicrystalline Si module.

    coefficients : array-like, optional
        user-defined coefficients, if not using one of the default coefficient
        sets via the ``module_type`` parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    mismatch: numeric
        spectral mismatch factor (unitless) which is multiplied
        with broadband irradiance reaching a module's cells to estimate
        effective irradiance, i.e., the irradiance that is converted to
        electrical current.

    Notes
    -----
    The JRC model parameterises the spectral mismatch factor as a function
    of air mass and the clear sky index as follows:

    .. math::

        M = 1 + a_1(e^{-k_c}-e^{-1}) + a_2(k_c-1)+a_3(AM-1.5),

    where :math:`M` is the spectral mismatch factor, :math:`k_c` is the clear
    sky index, :math:`AM` is the air mass, :math:`e` is Euler's number, and
    :math:`a_1, a_2, a_3` are module-specific coefficients. The :math:`a_n`
    coefficients available via the ``coefficients`` parameter differ from the
    :math:`k_n` coefficients documented in [1]_ in that they are normalised by
    the specific short-circuit current value, :math:`I_{sc0}^*`, which is the
    expected short-circuit current at standard test conditions indoors. The
    model used to estimate the air mass (denoted as :math:`AM`) is not stated
    in the original publication. The authors of [1]_ used the ESRA model [2]_
    to estimate the clear sky GHI for the clear sky index, which is the ratio
    of GHI to clear sky GHI. Also, prior to the calculation of :math:`k_c`, the
    irradiance measurements were corrected for angle of incidence using the
    Martin and Ruiz model [3]_.
