Gb(i): Beam (direct) irradiance on the inclined plane (plane of the array) (W/m2)
Gd(i): Diffuse irradiance on the inclined plane (plane of the array) (W/m2)
Gr(i): Reflected irradiance on the inclined plane (plane of the array) (W/m2)
H_sun: Sun height (degree)
T2m: 2-m air temperature (degree Celsius)
WS10m: 10-m total wind speed (m/s)
Int: 1 means solar radiation values are reconstructed
